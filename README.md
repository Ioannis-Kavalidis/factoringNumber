# Exercise:  Return the factorial of the provided integer.

*** If the integer is represented with the letter n, a factorial is the product of all positive integers less than or equal to n.

Factorials are often represented with the shorthand notation n!

5! = 1 * 2 * 3 * 4 * 5 = 120

Print your solution to the console.

 **Expected Output**
